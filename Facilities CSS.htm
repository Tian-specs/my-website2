		 <h2 class="library comment">WORK STUDY MEASUREMENT</h2>
		<p>Work Study is one of the core disciplines of Industrial Engineering, centered on improving operational efficiency and productivity in various systems. The laboratory is equipped with specialized tools such as stopwatches, time study boards, calipers, rulers, measuring tapes, and other precision instruments essential for conducting time and motion studies, method analysis, and process improvement. These tools are used to analyze job tasks, establish standard times, and design more efficient workflows in both manufacturing and service environments.
Throughout the course, students learn fundamental concepts such as method study, motion economy, process charting, and work sampling. They are trained to conduct time studies, determine standard time using performance rating and allowances, and apply Predetermined Motion Time Systems (PMTS) like MTM (Methods-Time Measurement). These lessons help students identify and eliminate unnecessary motions, streamline workflows, and create standardized work procedures that improve overall performance.

By applying these concepts and tools in practical exercises, students gain real-world skills in analyzing job elements, minimizing waste, and recommending effective improvements. The hands-on experience in this lab builds a strong foundation for future roles in operations management, production planning, lean manufacturing, and continuous improvement initiatives across various industries.


In hands-on sessions, students apply these tools to real-life scenarios, learning how to break down work elements, assess productivity, and develop data-driven recommendations for improvement. They gain practical experience in identifying waste, streamlining tasks, and enhancing workplace efficiency using systematic approaches.

Through these activities, students build a strong foundation in one of the most applied aspects of Industrial Engineering, preparing them for roles in operations, production planning, and continuous improvement initiatives across various industries. </p>

		 <h2 class="library comment">ERGONOMIC LABORATORY</h2>
		<p> The Ergonomics Laboratory is a specialized space where students explore the critical relationship between human capabilities and the design of work systems. It features modern tools and equipment including adjustable chairs and tables, anthropometric measurement kits, environmental sensors for lighting and sound, and software for posture analysis and workstation design. The lab supports both classroom instruction and project-based learning focused on optimizing human well-being and performance in the workplace.

Students conduct assessments of different workstations and environments, evaluating factors like posture, reach, visual comfort, repetitive motion, and noise levels. They are trained to identify ergonomic risks and apply principles that enhance safety, comfort, and efficiency. Real-life case studies and simulations help students understand how ergonomics can significantly improve both employee satisfaction and productivity.

By the end of the course, students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to design systems that are not only efficient but also human-centered—promoting health, safety, and performance in any industry they choose to enter. </p>
